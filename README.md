docker-varnish
==============

Simple docker varnish image with throttle module.

## Pulling

```
$ docker pull zenedith/varnish
```

## Running

```
$ docker run -d -e BACKEND_PORT_80_TCP_ADDR=example.com -e BACKEND_ENV_PORT=80 -p 8080:80 zenedith/varnish
```

You can pass environmental variables to customize configuration:

```
LISTEN_ADDR 0.0.0.0
LISTEN_PORT 80
BACKEND_ADDR 0.0.0.0
BAKCEND_PORT 80
TELNET_ADDR 0.0.0.0
TELNET_PORT 6083
CACHE_SIZE 25MB
THROTTLE_LIMIT 150req/30s
VCL_FILE /etc/varnish/default.vcl
GRACE_TTL 30s
GRACE_MAX 1h
```

## Building

From sources:

```
$ docker build github.com/Zenedith/docker-varnish
```

## Fig Dockerenv
```yml
varnish:
  image: avatarnewyork/dockerenv-varnish
  volumes:
    - /var/www/sandbox/varnish/etc/varnish:/etc/varnish
  ports:
    - "80"
  links:
    - sandbox # Your apache instance
  environment:
    VCL_FILE: /etc/varnish/default.vcl
```

### Varnish Config 
Due to the way varnish works with it's config file, there is no easy way to pass environment variables to it.  People have come up with a work-around: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21056450/how-to-inject-environment-variables-in-varnish-configuration - and that is actually similar to what our image is doing.  Basically, you'll have 2 files:

```
/etc/varnish/default.vcl.source
/etc/varnish/default.vcl
```

The source file contains any environment variables you want parsed (that are available).  The run command (part of the image) replaces the defined variables in the source file with the environment variable values using sed and outputs it to the .vcl file.  Then it starts varnish and reads the .vcl file.  So you can think of default.vcl.source as a template and the .vcl file as throwaway (as it get's overwritten every startup).

One thing to note is whatever you define in the yml file (VCL_FILE: /etc/varnish/default.vcl) needs a matching .source 

#### Example _default.vcl.source_
```vcl
# This is a basic VCL configuration file for varnish.  See the vcl(7)
# man page for details on VCL syntax and semantics.
#
# Default backend definition.  Set this to point to your content
# server.
#

backend default {
  .host = "$PATSANDBOX_1_PORT_80_TCP_ADDR";
  .port = "$PATSANDBOX_1_PORT_80_TCP_PORT";
}
```
